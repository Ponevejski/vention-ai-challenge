**Task:** Analyze unstructured product feedback comments and extract structured insights in JSON format. Use the following steps:  

1. **Relevance Check:**  
   - If the feedback is irrelevant to the product (e.g., off-topic, spam), set `isRelevant: false` and skip further analysis.  
   - If relevant, proceed with sentiment and detail extraction.  

2. **Sentiment Analysis:**  
   - Classify as `Positive`, `Negative`, `Neutral`, or `Mixed` based on tone and content.  

3. **Detail Extraction:**  
   - Identify `mainSubject` (primary product/feature discussed).  
   - List `positives` (explicit praise or strengths).  
   - List `painPoints` (complaints or issues).  
   - Infer `improvementSuggestions` (even if implicit).  
   - Tag `featuresMentioned` (specific functionalities).  
   - Gauge `userExpertise` (`Experienced`, `Novice`, or `Unknown`).  

**Few-Shot Examples:**  
```json
// Example 1: Negative feedback with technical details  
{
  "sentiment": "Negative",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "Mouse sensor",
  "positives": [],
  "painPoints": ["Sensor stops tracking intermittently", "Faulty dongle"],
  "improvementSuggestions": ["Fix sensor stability", "Improve dongle reliability"],
  "featuresMentioned": ["8000Hz polling rate"],
  "userExpertise": "Experienced"
}

// Example 2: Mixed feedback on value proposition  
{
  "sentiment": "Mixed",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "Product value",
  "positives": ["No flaws in performance"],
  "painPoints": ["Overpriced compared to alternatives"],
  "improvementSuggestions": ["Adjust pricing strategy"],
  "featuresMentioned": [],
  "userExpertise": "Novice"
}

4. **Chain-of-Thought Instructions:**

For each sample, first ask: Is this feedback product-related? If no, mark isRelevant: false.

If yes, analyze sentiment and extract details step-by-step (e.g., "User mentions sensor issues → painPoint; suggests fixes → improvement").

Infer expertise from technical terms (e.g., "8000Hz" → "Experienced").

5. **Output Requirements:**

- Strictly adhere to the JSON schema.

- Escape special characters (e.g., \n for newlines).



 **Feedback Samples to Analyze:**

"Sensor just stops tracking for like a half second kinda often even at 8000hz. I've also tried it plugged in and still the same problem. First one I got I had to return also because the dongle just didnt work, $150 mouse btw"

"Is it worth it? It is a product with no flaws in my opinion, if you love it go for it, but its not worth the price since you'll be able to perform the same with a cheaper product with half the specs."
