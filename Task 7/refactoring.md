# Sea Battle Game Refactoring

## Overview
The original codebase has been completely refactored to follow modern JavaScript practices and improve code organization, maintainability, and testability. The new implementation maintains all the original game mechanics while providing a more robust and extensible architecture.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Modern JavaScript Features
- ES6+ syntax (classes, modules, arrow functions)
- Proper use of `const` and `let`
- Template literals for string interpolation
- Destructuring and spread operators
- Modern array methods

### 2. Code Organization
- Modular architecture with separate concerns
- Clear class hierarchy and inheritance
- Proper encapsulation of game state
- Separation of game logic from UI/IO

### 3. New Class Structure
- `Board`: Manages the game grid and cell states
- `Ship`: Handles ship placement and hit tracking
- `Player`: Base class for player functionality
- `CPUPlayer`: Extends Player with AI logic
- `Game`: Orchestrates the game flow

### 4. Improved AI
- Maintained the original 'hunt' and 'target' modes
- More efficient target queue management
- Better position validation

### 5. Testing
- Comprehensive unit tests for all classes
- Test coverage above 60%
- Isolated test cases for each component
- Mock-free testing where possible

### 6. Error Handling
- Better input validation
- Clear error messages
- Graceful error recovery

### 7. Code Quality
- Consistent code style
- Clear naming conventions
- Proper documentation
- Reduced code duplication

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- Node.js with ES modules
- Jest for testing
- No external dependencies for core game logic

## Future Improvements
1. Add configuration file for game settings
2. Implement save/load game state
3. Add different difficulty levels
4. Create web-based UI
5. Add multiplayer support
