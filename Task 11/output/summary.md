A 25-year-old healthy engineering student, who also works part-time as a postman, presents with sharp, brief chest pains over the area of the heart lasting about three days. The pain worsens with coughing or lying down, improves when leaning forward, rates a 6/10 in intensity, and sometimes radiates to the neck. There are no other symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, or viral symptoms currently, though the patient recently recovered from the flu. There is no history of prior similar pain, medical conditions, surgeries, medication use (other than occasional Tylenol), allergies, smoking, or drug use. Notably, the patient's father had a fatal heart attack two weeks ago, increasing the patient's anxiety about having a heart attack. The patient lives with their mother, drinks alcohol occasionally, and denies recreational drug use. The healthcare provider empathizes with the patient's fears, plans to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests, and advises not to worry excessively until results are available.
