Hey

I have a task for you

We should decide what kind of DB we would better use in the project

The initial requirements are: 
Social platform with millions of users
Need to store profiles, posts, and connections between users
High data read speed required
Expected 80% read operations, 20% write operations
Scalability is important as the user base grows

Check it out please. We would continue step-by-step on each option.
So, lets start

1. Identify the key needs
2. Evaluate Database Types
3. Shortlist Candidates
4. Select Best Fit
5.  Address Trade-offs
6. Provide a final recommendation with a summary table comparing options.
